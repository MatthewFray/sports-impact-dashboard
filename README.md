# Sport Impact Dashboard API

A FastAPI backend for analyzing and exposing sports performance and impact data.

This project is currently in early development. The focus so far has been building a clean, modular backend architecture that can scale as real data sources and analytics are added.

---

## Current Status

The API currently includes:

- A health check endpoint
- A teams endpoint with optional league filtering
- A team impact endpoint (using stub data)
- Modular router-based architecture
- Pydantic schemas for structured data validation

This establishes the foundation for expanding into real analytics and data integration.
